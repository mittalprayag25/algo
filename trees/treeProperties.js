/*  types of Binary tree
    1. Full Binary Tree : 
      A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. 
      The following are the examples of a full binary tree


               18
            /     \  
          40       30  
                   /  \
                 100   40

    2. Complete Binary Tree
      A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences:
      Every level must be completely filled
      All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
      The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. 
      a complete binary tree doesnâ€™t have to be a full binary tree.
          18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40
     /  \   /
    8   7  9 

    3. Perfeect Binary Tree
      A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and 
      all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
      It is a Full Binary Tree: just that all leaf nodes at same level
              18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40


               18
           /       \  
         15         30 

    4. Balanced Binary tree
      It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the 
      height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1

    5. Degenerate Binary Tree
        10
          /
        20
        \
        30
          \
          40  
    6. Skewed Binary Tree
